<h2>Summary</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">
In this project, we aim to create a planetary ring formation simulation, which simulates how asteroids, comets, and other large objects interact when they travel too close to a planet.
</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">
    This simulation is challenging due to the various forces interacting with each astronomical object. We plan to tackle this through researching the relevant physics and implementing them similar to the project 4 approach. Ideally, the net force on an object should be centripetal, and the objects would follow a circular path. To simulate a smooth circular path would also require a unique position update algorithm.
</p>

<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<p style="line-height: 2">
    Our eventual deliverable would be a simulation demo of planetary ring formation.
    <br><br>
    Metric: the demo should successfully simulate a <Strong>smooth</Strong> formation of a <strong>ring</strong>.
    <br><br>
    Plan to deliver: A basic simulation where entering astronomical objects interact with each other and the central planet, eventually circulating the planet and forming a ring around it.
    <br><br>
    Hope to deliver: An interactive simulation which also contains an interactive interface for adjusting key parameters like gravity, properties of particles and other objects in real time. Ideally, we would also want to simulate an incoming light ray and display different brightness levels for each astronomical object due to light.
</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p style="line-height:2">
    Week1: Find suitable physics engine for simulation and relevant paper for reference. Set up the overall environment.
    <br>
    Week2: Write code to simulate the behaviors of different astronomical objects and how they should interact with each other. Work on the position update algorithm.
    <br>
    Week3: Render the plain physics simulation into videos according to the texture and lighting of different astronomical objects.
    <br>
    Week4: Finalize and if everything goes well, try to build an interactive interface.
